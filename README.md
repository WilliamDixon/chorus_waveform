# Waveform Conversion Scripts
Various waveform conversion scripts for the CHoRUS project. Feel free to add code that converts your waveform format to HDF5, or to an intermediate format that can be used with an existing converter. Recommended organization is one tool per folder, with folders for different versions if applicable. You can add a short description below, with more detailed instructions in a readme in the subfolder.

# UVA Format Converter
Converts between a variety of formats, including inputs of Bedmaster STP XML, wfdb, tdms, dwc, and existing HDF5. Vitals can be specified as a CSV if not included in waveform file. See UVAFormatConverter folder for more detailed information.
